# Operators

## Arithmetic

* addition: `left + right`
* subtraction: `left - right`
* multiplication: `left * right`
* division: `left / right`
* modulus: `left % right`
* power: `left ^ right`
* negate: `-[operand]`

## Bitwise

* bit and: `[left] band [right]`
* bit or: `[left] bor [right]`
* bit xor: `[left] bxor [right]`
* bit left shift: `[left] bls [right]`
* bit right shift: `[left] brs [right]`
* bit inverse: `biv [operand]`

## Logical

* equal to: `left == right`
* not equal to: `left != right`
* greater than: `left > right`
* less than: `left < right`
* greater than or equal to: `left >= right`
* less than or equal to: `left <= right`
* not true: `![operand]`
